# flutter_unit_test

2.Select the Run menu
3.Click the Run 'tests in counter_test.dart' option
4.Alternatively, use the appropriate keyboard shortcut for your platform.

VSCode
1.Open the any of the test files (example movie_test.dart) file
2.Select the Run menu
3.Click the Start Debugging option
4.Alternatively, use the appropriate keyboard shortcut for your platform.
